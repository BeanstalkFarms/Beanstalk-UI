    <h2 id="earn-interest-on-beans">Earn Interest on Beans</h2>
    <p>There are 2 ways to earn interest directly from Beanstalk:</p>
    <ul>

      <li><a href="#become-a-bean-farmer">Become a Bean Farmer</a></li>

    <p>Anyone can become a Silo Member by Depositing Beans or LP Tokens for the Bean:ETH Uniswap liquidity pool into the Silo. Upon Deposit, Silo Members receive Stalk and Seeds. Stalk is the governance token of Beanstalk. Every season, .0001 additional Stalk Grows from each Seed.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of each Season, if the Bean supply increases, a portion of the new Bean supply is distributed to Stalk holders in proportion to their Stalk ownership. All Bean distributions to Silo Members are automatically Deposited into the Silo, and receive Stalk and Seeds.</p>

    <p>Assets can be Withdrawn from the Silo at anytime, and become liquid at the start of the 25th Season after Withdrawal. All Stalk and Seeds associated with a Deposit are forfeited upon Withdrawal.</p>

    <h2 id="understand-my-holdings-in-beanstalk">Understand My Holdings in Beanstalk</h2>
    <p>There are many different assets in the Beanstalk ecosystem. The "Balances" module in the "Analytics" section contains a complete summary of both your assets in the ecosystem, and the totals for the entire Beanstalk ecosystem. Analytics > Balances.</p>
    <p>You can also click on your address on the top of the website to view your Beanstalk balances in the "My Balances" tab.</p>
    <p>Bean values are denominated in Beans. LP Token values are denomiated in small decimals. If you hover over an amount of LP with your mouse, the website displays the Beans and ETH under that LP Token amount.</p>
    <p>Bean and LP Deposits and Withdrawals are listed individually in the "Silo" section. The table will show when you click on the list menu dropdown in the bottom left of the module.</p>
    <p>PLEASE NOTE: Whenever you have assets Deposited in the Silo and are rewarded with new Beans or Stalk, they will appear with your Bean Deposits listed as Farmable. The next time you perform a transaction in the Silo, Farmable Beans and Stalk will be grouped into a Bean Deposit and removed from the Farmable season row.</p>
    <h2 id="understand-my-beanstalk-transactions">Understand My Beanstalk Transactions</h2>
    <p>If you click your address in the top right of the website, you can view all your transactions in Beanstalk under the "Transactions" tab. You can select from the subtabs to filter by transaction type.</p>
    <h2 id="use-beans">Use Beans</h2>
    <p>Beanstalk is designed to interoperate with the entire Ethereum ecosystem. No actions are ever required from everyday Bean users. Over time, as Beanstalk demonstrates utility by consistently crossing the Bean price over $1, we expect Beans to be incorporated into various other Ethereum-native protocols. Let your favorite dApps know you want them to incorporate Beans in their protocol!</p>
    <p>Today, you can use your Beans to participate in Bean Farming and Beanstalk Governance.</p>
