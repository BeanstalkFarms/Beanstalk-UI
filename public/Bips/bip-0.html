<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>In Beanstalk version 1.0.1, gas costs for Silo Members to update their Silo are extremely high and increase over time. The method Beanstalk currently uses to calculate compounding interest limits access to smaller Silo Members through prohibitive costs.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>A new method to reward compounding interest to Silo Members for a fixed gas cost.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-functional-changes">Proposed Functional Changes:</h3>
<p>Unclaimed Stalk that has grown from Claimed Seeds do not earn interest until they are Claimed. Unclaimed Stalk that has grown from Claimed Seeds do not count towards BIPs.</p>
<p>Claimed Stalk and Unclaimed Stalk from Unclaimed Seeds will continue to receive compounding interest from supply increases and Seasons of Plenty, and automatically be counted towards BIPs, as before.</p>
<h3 id="bip-specific-notes">BIP Specific Notes:</h3>
<p>All Unclaimed Beans, Unclaimed Seeds and Unclaimed Stalk from supply increases will be forfeited and divided equally to Stalk owners at the time this BIP is committed.</p>
<p>All Unclaimed ETH from Seasons of Plenty will be forfeited and divided equally to Stalk owners as part of the first Season of Plenty that takes place after this BIP is committed.</p>
<h3 id="effective">Effective:</h3>
<p>Effective immediately upon commit.</p>
