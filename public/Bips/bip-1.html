<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mint 120,000 Beans to an initial development budget.</li>
  <li>Mint 80,000 Beans to an initial marketing budget.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li style='margin-right:2px;'>Establish a process for specific allocations of each budget leveraging Snapshot.</li>
  <li>Fund initial proposals to hire a full-time front-end dev and a part-time community organizer.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>As the Beanstalk community expands, the Silo should start coordinating continued development of Beanstalk and the Beanstalk community. Beginning the process of establishing long term support for the Beanstalk ecosystem independent of Publius is essential to the long-term success of Beanstalk.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>We propose Beanstalk mints and allocates 200,000 Beans to start this process. This budget should fund dev and marketing needs through the end of 2021.</p>
<h3 id="budget-allocation-details">Budget Allocation Details:</h3>
<p>To ensure widespread and inexpensive participation in allocation of the budgets, we propose leveraging <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/beanstalkfarms.eth">Snapshot</a> to vote on specific allocations of the budgets.</p>
<p>Upon passage, we will open #dev-budget and #marketing-budget channels in the Beanstalk Discord to facilitate discussion on potential proposals.</p>
<h3 id="effective">Effective:</h3>
<p>Effective immediately upon commit.</p>
