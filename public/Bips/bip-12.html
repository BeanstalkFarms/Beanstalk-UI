<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrade the Silo to support arbitrary token Deposits, based on a token whitelist.</li>
  <li>Add the BEAN:3CRV Curve pool to the whitelist for 1 Stalk and 4 Seeds per Bean denominated value (BDV) Deposited.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>The Silo currently only supports Deposits of Beans and LP Tokens for the BEAN:ETH Uniswap V2 pool. As the sophistication of the Beanstalk ecosystem increases, (<i>e.g.</i>, the BEAN:3CRV Curve pool) it is essential that the Silo can scale to accept arbitrary tokens.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>The Silo will accept arbitrary token Deposits based on a token whitelist. Each token on the whitelist must include a formula for BDV, and the Stalk and Seed values per BDV Deposited.</p>
<p>Tokens can be added to the Silo whitelist via BIP. Tokens on the whitelist can be Deposited, Withdrawn, and Claimed, but not Converted.</p>
<h4 id="economic-rationale">Economic Rationale:</h4>
<p>Incorporating other assets into the Silo via a whitelist allows Beanstalk to offer Stalk and Seed rewards to arbitrary liquidity pools, assets and protocols that are benefiting Beanstalk in some capacity.</p>
<p>The BEAN:3CRV Curve Pool has started attracting liquidity, which has significantly decreased (1) price deviations from the value peg and (2) the correlation of the Bean and Ether prices. Offering Stalk and Seed rewards for Depositing the BEAN:3CRV Curve LP Tokens into the Silo is likely to both increase the stickiness of the capital currently in the pool and attract new liquidity to the pool.</p>
<h3 id="effective">Effective:</h3>
<p>Effective immediately upon commit.</p>
<h3 id="award">Award:</h3>
<p>5000 Beans to Beanstalk Farms.</p>
