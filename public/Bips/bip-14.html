<h3 id="summary" style="padding-top:10px;">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mint 2,000,000 Beans to fund Beanstalk Farms to retain, grow and support a group of core contributors through the end of Q2 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goals" style="padding-top:10px;">Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Decentralized Development - A diverse organization without any single point of failure or dependence.</li>
  <li>Scale - Grow the team to roughly 60 dependable core contributors, which we estimate will provide the protocol with ample full-stack support.</li>
  <li>Seamless Onboarding and Accountable Work Streams - Maintain an onboarding process that empowers new contributors to quickly get up to speed and produce at a high level.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="amounts" style="padding-top:10px;">Amounts:</h3>
<p>We propose a total of 2,000,000 Beans are minted to fund Beanstalk Farms through the end of Q2 2022. 383,209.94 Beans remain unspent by Beanstalk Farms in Q1. These Beans will be rolled over into Q2, resulting in a total budget allocation of 2,389,209.94 Beans.</p>
<h3 id="initial-allocations" style="padding-top:10px;">Initial Allocations:</h3>
<p>Each new Beanstalk Farms contributor will have an individual Snapshot proposal after the Budget Proposal is passed by a vote of the DAO, utilizing the above processes. Current contributors will only require a Snapshot proposal if their role or pay has significantly changed since Q1, or the entire payment from their previous proposal has been made.</p>
<h3 id="incentive-alignment" style="padding-top:10px;">Incentive Alignment:</h3>
<p>The Beanstalk community has decided to disallow core contributors from receiving any portion of their compensation in Pods. Beginning in Q2 2022, contributors will receive 100% of compensation in Beans.</p>
<p>In the future, whenever Deposits become transferrable, Beanstalk Farms will try to offer the ability to Deposit all or a portion of ones Bean allocation upon approval of their Snapshot proposal, and then make payment in the form of Deposited Beans.</p>
<h3 id="competitive-pay" style="padding-top:10px;">Competitive Pay:</h3>
<p>Beanstalk Farms recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Beanstalk’s long-term success. As a result of the community’s recent decision to disallow compensation in the form of Pods, as outlined above and in <a href="https://beanstalkfarmsdao.notion.site/BGM-1-Contributor-Compensation-1db5a6a886f440e08c395cae53efc3da" target="break">Beanstalk Governance Memorandum 1</a>, several pay increases will be proposed via Snapshot.</p>
