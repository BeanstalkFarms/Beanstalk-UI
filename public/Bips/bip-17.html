<h3 id="summary" style="padding-top:10px;">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mint 3,000,000 Beans to fund Bean Sprout to seed, grow and support various Beanstalk-related integrations, projects, and initiatives through the end of Q2 2022.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goals" style="padding-top:10px;">Goals:</h3>
<p>We designed the Q2 2022 budget to enable Bean Sprout to support the Beanstalk ecosystem in a complementary fashion to Beanstalk Farms, which is dedicated to improving the protocol more directly. With that in mind, Bean Sprout intends to focus on the following goals:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Deepen liquidity within the Silo and Beanstalk assets</li>
  <li>Grow the Beanstalk ecosystem by incubating and accelerating valuable Bean use cases</li>
  <li>Strategically acquire assets such as CVX to promote Beanstalk’s market positioning</li>
  <li>Attract, support and retain talent to operate Bean Sprout</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="amounts" style="padding-top:10px;">Amounts:</h3>
<p>We propose a total of 3,000,000 Beans are minted to fund Bean Sprout through the end of Q2 2022. 698,050 Beans remain unspent by Bean Sprout in Q1. These Beans will be rolled over into Q2, resulting in a total budget allocation of 3,698,050 Beans.</p>
<h3 id="incentive-alignment" style="padding-top:10px;">Incentive Alignment:</h3>
<p>The Beanstalk community has decided to disallow core contributors from receiving any portion of their compensation in Pods. Beginning in Q2 2022, contributors will receive 100% of compensation in Beans.</p>
<p>In the future, whenever Deposits become transferrable, Beanstalk Sprout will try to offer the ability to Deposit all or a portion of ones Bean allocation upon approval of their Snapshot proposal, and then make payment in the form of Deposited Beans.</p>
<h3 id="competitive-pay" style="padding-top:10px;">Competitive Pay:</h3>
<p>Bean Sprout recognizes that its ability to pay contributors competitive wages is essential to Beanstalk’s long-term success and will ensure that it meets or exceeds market rates.</p>
