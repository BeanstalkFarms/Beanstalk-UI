<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>Raising capital and forming connections with other protocols in a decentralized, anonymous capacity is difficult. While Beanstalk has succeeded in attracting substantial initial capital, Beanstalk must continue to grow in order to attract other crypto projects to utilize $BEAN as a reliable stablecoin.   Over the past few weeks, Publius has spoken with a variety of potential long-term, high quality capital to explain how Beanstalk works. While this has resulted in a strong organic network forming around Beanstalk, anonymity makes it difficult for Publius to tap into a larger network of potential investors. Furthermore, time spent managing relationships with potential investors is time spent away from developing Beanstalk.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>Upon passage, the Silo will hire Justin de Guzman as Capital Formation Advisor.</p>
<p>Upon passage, Beanstalk will mint and allocate 300,000 Beans to hire a full Capital Formation Advisor for 2 years. 240,000 of these Beans will be allocated to hire Justin for 2 years. The remaining 60,000 Beans will be allocated for expenses related to capital formation.</p>
<h3 id="resume">Resume:</h3>
<p>Justin was previously at Social Capital, a prominent, Palo Alto-based venture firm, where he worked on the investment team for Chamath Palihapitiya. He is also currently a scout for Lightspeed Venture Partners. His extensive network in the venture capital, hedge fund, and crypto communities will allow Beanstalk to develop relationships with long-term capital. Justin is also currently one of the top pod holders.</p>
