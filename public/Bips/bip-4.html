<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hire Trail of Bits to perform a code audit on Beanstalk.</li>
  <li>Establish a "Fundraiser" process that allows Beanstalk to efficiently raise capital in a decentralized manner to make payments in another stablecoin.</li>
  <li>Mint 347,400 Beans and create the first Fundraiser to raise 347,400 USDC in exchange for the 347,400 Beans to pay for the Trail of Bits audit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>Beanstalk is unaudited at the moment.  A high quality audit will facilitate further growth and adoption. In addition, there are regular updates to the code through BIPs. It is important to have an auditor that will continue working with Beanstalk after the initial audit to facilitate timely and efficient code reviews for BIPs.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>Upon passage of this BIP and payment of 347,400 USDC, Trail of Bits will perform an initial audit for Beanstalk and retain a continuous relationship with Beanstalk to review future versions of the code. They have audited many of the top DeFi projects, which are viewable <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications#smart-contracts" target="break"> here</a>.</p>
<p>This BIP proposes a "Fundraiser" standard that will allow Beanstalk to raise money to pay for things in other stablecoins, without requiring sales on Uniswap. Instead, Fundraisers will first mint a pre-defined number of Beans, to be bought 1:1 for a pre-defined stablecoin. Each Bean purchased in exchange for 1 of the stablecoin will be sown at the current Weather, and the Pods received in exchange will be sent to the wallet that bought the Beans. Beacause all the Beans being Sown were minted as part of the Fundraiser, no Soil will be used to mint Pods by the FundraiserFacet. </p>
<h3 id="payment">Payment:</h3>
<p>Upon approval, this BIP will mint 347,400 Beans to fund the Trail of Bits audit. Upon deployment of the Fundraiser, anyone can sell USDC to Beanstalk in exchange for sown Beans. For each of the first 347,400 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Bean will be sown and the corresponding Pods returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.</p>
