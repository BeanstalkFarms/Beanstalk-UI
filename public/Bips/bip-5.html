<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hire Omniscia to perform a code audit on Beanstalk.</li>
  <li>Leverage the "Fundraiser" process proposed in BIP-4 to mint the Beans and raise the USDC necessary to pay for the Omniscia audit.</li>
  <li>Mint 155,000 Beans and create a Fundraiser to raise 140,000 USDC in exchange for 140,000 Bean. Pay Omniscia 140,000 USDC + 15,000 Beans for the audit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>Beanstalk is unaudited at the moment. A high quality audit will facilitate further growth and adoption.</p>
<h3 id="proposed-solution">Proposed Solution:</h3>
<p>Omniscia is a very high quality smart contract auditor, and has experience auditing other ERC-2535 Diamonds. Their audit history is available <a href="https://omniscia.io/index.html#clients" target="break"> here</a>.</p>
<p>Upon passage of this BIP, Omniscia will perform an initial audit for Beanstalk.</p>
<p>This BIP leverages the "Fundraiser" standard proposed in BIP-4 that allows Beanstalk to raise money to pay for things in other stablecoins.</p>
<h3 id="payment">Payment:</h3>
<p>The cost of the contract (initial audit) is 140,000 USDC and 15,000 Beans, paid in 4 payments.</p>
<p>Upon approval, this BIP will mint 155,000 Beans to fund the Omniscia audit and start a Fundraiser for 140,000 USDC. Upon the start of the Fundraiser, anyone can send USDC to the FundraiserFacet in exchange for sown Beans. For each of the first 140,000 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Bean will be sown and the corresponding Pods returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.</p>
