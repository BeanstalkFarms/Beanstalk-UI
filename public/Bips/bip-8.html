<h3 id="summary" style="padding-top:10px;">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Mint 1,200,000 Beans to fund Beanstalk Farms to train and retain a set of core contributors through the end of Q1 2022.</li>
  <li>Mint 800,000 Beans to fund Bean Sprout, a new Beanstalk accelerator program to facilitate rapid development on and around Beanstalk in a decentralized fashion, through the end of Q1 2022.</li>
  <li>Allow Beanstalk contributors to elect to sow an arbitrary percentage (0-100%) of their allocated Beans, independent of whether there is a sufficient amount of Soil outstanding.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="goals" style="padding-top:10px;">Goals:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Decentralized Development - A diverse organization without any single points of failure or dependence.</li>
  <li>Targeted and Flexible - Able to deliver high quality core products in a timely fashion, while having the flexibility to fund and support a wide variety of unique opportunities related to Beanstalk.</li>
  <li>Scalable - Workable in its current size (dozen+ full time, 2 dozen+ part time) and scalable to hundreds as Beanstalk continues to grow.</li>
  <li>Plug and Play - Make it easy for new contributors to get up and running in a timely manner, and for non full-time contributors to stay on top of their deliverables and add value.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="structure" style="padding-top:10px;">Structure:</h3>
<p>In order to meet the above goals, we propose funding two separate, symbiotic operations in Q1: Beanstalk Farms and Bean Sprout.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beanstalk Farms - A decentralized team of core contributors to Beanstalk, operating across the stack on technical and non-technical problems. Designed to hire, train and retain long term contributors to Beanstalk working approximately 20-30+ hours per week.</li>
  <li>Bean Sprout - A Beanstalk Accelerator program designed to encourage the flexible and swift funding and development of new projects to support the Beanstalk ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="amounts" style="padding-top:10px;">Amounts:</h3>
<p>We propose a total of 2,000,000 Beans are minted to fund both programs through the end of Q1 with the following distribution:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beanstalk Farms - 1,200,000 Beans</li>
  <li>Bean Sprout - 800,000 Beans</li>
</ul>
