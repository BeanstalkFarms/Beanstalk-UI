<ul>
  <li>Decrease the Withdrawal Freeze twice a week for 6 weeks and then once a week for 8 weeks. After 14 weeks, the Withdrawal Freeze will be 4 Seasons.</li>

  <li>Change the formula for the Soil at the start of each Season (\(S_t^{\text{start}}\)) to:</li>
$$
S_t^{\text{start}} = \text{max}\left(-\Delta\bar{b}_{t-1}, \frac{h_t}{1+\frac{w}{100}}\right)
$$
  <li>Change the inputs to the formulas for \(\bar{b}_{t-1}^*\) and \(\bar{b}_{t-1}\) (<i>i.e.</i>, \(b_{t-1},\ y_{t-1}\))  to reflect the number of Beans and Y under the LP Tokens for the BEAN:Y liquidity pool in the Silo at the end of the previous Season.</li>
