<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hire Trail of Bits to perform a code audit on Beanstalk and maintain a continuous relationship with Beanstalk to review future versions of the code. They have audited many of the top DeFi projects, which are viewable <a href="https://github.com/trailofbits/publications#smart-contracts" target="break"> here</a>.</li>
  <li>Mint 347,440 Beans and create the first Fundraiser to raise 347,440 USDC in exchange for the 347,440 Beans to pay for the Trail of Bits audit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps:</h3>
<p>Upon approval, this BIP will mint 347,440 Beans to fund the Trail of Bits audit. Upon deployment of the Fundraiser, anyone can sell USDC to Beanstalk in exchange for sown Beans. For each of the first 347,440 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Bean will be sown and the corresponding Pods returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.</p>
