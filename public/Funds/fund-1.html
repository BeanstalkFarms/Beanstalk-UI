<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hire Omniscia to perform a code audit on Beanstalk and maintain a continuous relationship with Beanstalk to review future versions of the code. Their audit history is available <a href="https://omniscia.io/index.html#clients" target="break"> here</a>.</li>
  <li>Mint 155,000 Beans and create a Fundraiser to raise 140,000 USDC in exchange for 140,000 Bean. Pay Omniscia 140,000 USDC + 15,000 Beans for the audit.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Next Steps:</h3>
<p>The cost of the contract (initial audit) is 140,000 USDC and 15,000 Beans, paid in 4 payments.</p>
<p>Upon approval, this BIP will mint 155,000 Beans to fund the Omniscia audit and start a Fundraiser for 140,000 USDC. Upon the start of the Fundraiser, anyone can send USDC to the FundraiserFacet in exchange for sown Beans. For each of the first 140,000 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Bean will be sown and the corresponding Pods returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.</p>
