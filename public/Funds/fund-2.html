<h3 id="summary">Summary:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Hire Omniscia to perform a continuous code audit on Beanstalk to facilitate the swift proposal of new BIPs by Beanstalk Farms.</li>
  <li>Leverage the "Fundraiser" process proposed in BIP-4 to mint the Beans and raise the USDC necessary to pay for the Omniscia retainer.</li>
  <li>Mint 250,000 Beans and create a Fundraiser to raise 250,000 USDC in exchange for 250,000 Beans. Pay Omniscia 250,000 USDC for the retainer.</li>
  <li>Transfer 50,000 Beans from Beanstalk Farms to Omnsicia as a down payment, to be returned upon completion of the retainer payment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="next-steps">Process:</h3>
<p>This Fundraiser will raise 250,000 USDC to fund the Omniscia retainer fee. Upon deployment of the Fundraiser, anyone can sell USDC to Beanstalk in exchange for sown Beans. For each of the first 250,000 USDC sent to the FundraiserFacet, 1 Bean will be sown and the corresponding Pods returned to the sender based on the Weather at the time of the sow.</p>
